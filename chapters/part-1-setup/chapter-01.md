# Chapter 1: The Blue That Lies

The pool looked like a mouth holding its breath.

Brody Finch saw it through the chain-link gate as the ride-share rolled past the hostel. A flat rectangle of turquoise set into a courtyard, walled off by sun-bleached concrete and potted palms that were mostly dead. The water was too still in the heat, as if it had been told to wait. He took that personally.

He could have been reasonable and said, Nice. Later. A shower, a nap, an actual meal. But the pool caught him in the same way a cliff edge does, the little vertigo of want. Water was his element. It had been since he was nine and his mother decided swimming would fix everything it couldn't. The pool was the only place in the world that didn't argue back.

The driver killed the engine. The heat inched in. Brody wiped his palm on his shorts and grabbed his bag. His phone buzzed with a message from a sponsor he wasn't going to answer until he got at least one hero shot. He glanced up at the sign on the fence: NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY. SWIM AT YOUR OWN RISK. The letters were sun-faded, like an old warning no one believed.

Good, he thought. If there was a lifeguard, they'd make me wear a wristband.

---

The hostel called itself the Blue Willow, which was either a lie or a joke. The tree in the courtyard was a plastic palm. The front desk was a chipped counter with a bell that had been rung into exhaustion. Behind it, a girl in a lime-green tank top chewed gum and watched him with half-lidded eyes, like he was an app update she did not care to install.

"Checking in?" she said.

Brody leaned his elbow on the counter and smiled the way he'd practiced, the one that made people think he was easy. "Name's Brody. Two nights. I booked the eight-bed." He glanced past her to the wall of hooks and the rack of cheap souvenir towels. "Is the pool open?"

She looked over her shoulder, as if the pool might answer. "Pool is..." She rolled her gum to the other side of her mouth. "Pool is open when it is open. It is not for children. No glass. Don't run. You understand?"

"I understand all of those words individually," Brody said.

Her mouth twitched like she might smile and decided against it. She slid a clipboard across the counter with a pen tied on a string. The sign-in sheet was smeared with sunscreen fingerprints. He wrote his name in block letters, because in his head his name always looked better that way.

"Passport?" she asked.

He passed it over. She looked at his photo and his face and decided they matched. "Room twelve. Back of the third floor. If you lose the key it is ten dollars. If you break it, it is twenty. If you bring guests, it is not allowed." She handed it over like she was passing a stone in a river.

He took the key, felt the cold teeth of it in his palm. "Any rules about diving?"

"Pool is not deep," she said. "Everything is broken if you dive. You understand?"

"I understand everything is broken," he said. "Got it."

She waved him through without looking up. The air smelled like floor cleaner and wet concrete. The lobby fan pushed the scent around without cooling it. A chalkboard sign advertised a "SUNSET SANGRIA" that had expired sometime around the last election.

Brody put his backpack down by the common room and looked around like he was casing a stage. A couple of tourists with guidebooks were on the couch, their knees touching, their faces locked in the mutual terror of a two-week trip. A pair of girls in matching hats were on a video call, narrating their every move in two languages. A man in a sleeveless shirt with a tattoo of a compass was asleep in a hammock strung between two columns, his mouth open and his chest rising like a bellows.

He took a photo of the room for his feed and cropped out the mold. He added a caption in his head: "Budget travel isn't a vibe, it's a sport." The dark humor of it made him smirk. Brody had always been good at making jokes that made people not look too closely.

He went up the stairs, the key heavy in his pocket. The hallway was lined with doors that swelled at the bottom from humidity. His room smelled like wet backpacks and something sour. Seven bunks were already claimed. He chose the top of the nearest empty one, because he liked the high ground.

He tossed his bag onto the mattress, changed into swim shorts, and headed back downstairs without even looking at the map of the city someone had taped to the wall.

---

The pool was smaller up close, but it was still water and water still meant possibility. The courtyard was a rectangle of hot tile and cracked planters. A bar sat at one end with a tin roof and a chalk menu for drinks in a language he didn't speak. No bartender. No music. The pool pump was on, humming like a box of bees somewhere in the corner.

He dumped his towel on a chaise lounge and walked the perimeter, gauging the depth by the color shift. Three feet on the shallow end, maybe five and a half at the deep. The tile around the edge was painted, not sealed, and the blue paint was flaking like sunburn. Along the far wall a metal ladder was bolted into place, and the bolts were rusted, the metal furred with orange. The water was so clear he could see the bottom, except in the center where a shadow pooled over the drain.

He crouched and touched the water. It was colder than he'd expected. It made his skin rise. There was a faint chemical smell, like bleach and pennies. He didn't mind it. Bleach meant clean. Pennies meant metal. Metal meant machinery. Machinery meant someone had, at some point, been responsible.

He ran his palm along the tile line and felt a ridge where the grout had cracked. It was rough and grainy. A small chip of blue tile floated at the edge like a tooth.

"You're early," a voice said.

Brody looked up. A man in his forties, lean, with a neck like rope, stood by the bar. He wore a polo with the hostel logo, which made him some kind of staff. He held a bucket of ice by the handle like it was a dumbbell.

"Just me and the pool," Brody said.

The man tipped his head at the water. "We clean it at noon."

"It's noon," Brody said, checking his phone. It was 12:07.

"We clean it when the sun is higher," the man said. He tossed the ice into a cooler with a clatter. "You swim now, you will be swimming in vacuum cleaner."

Brody laughed. "I've swum with worse."

The man shrugged and went back inside. The remark sat in the air for a moment, like a fly. Brody decided it was a joke. It had to be.

He posted a story of the empty pool with a polling sticker: "Swim now or nap first?" It felt good to ask a question you already knew the answer to. He dropped his phone on the towel and got in.

The water took him like a hand. He pushed off the wall and did a quick length, just to feel it out. The depth was shallow enough that his fingertips scraped the bottom on a stroke. It was a little gritty, like sand in a bathtub. He surfaced and spat water, a habit from chlorine-heavy pools, and ran a wet hand through his hair.

He floated on his back, eyes closed, letting the sun hammer his chest. A bird called somewhere above him. The pump hummed. The courtyard was empty except for a stray cat that had perched on a planter and was watching him with the bored authority of something that could have been a god in a different climate.

He told himself he would just float for a minute, then get out and do the real work: the edited version of travel where you only keep the clean parts.

A ripple moved under him. He opened his eyes. The ripple died against the wall. Nothing else. He kicked and drifted to the shallow end, grabbed the edge, and pulled himself out.

He shook the water from his arms, felt the heat of the tile, and noticed the drain cover. It wasn't so much a cover as a ring, a metal circle set into the floor with a grid of bars, and the bars were bent. He knelt by it, peering down. The hole below was dark. He couldn't see the pipe. He could feel the suction on his fingertips when he dipped them in.

He grinned. The pool had a pulse.

"You should not do that," the receptionist called from the doorway. She had appeared without his noticing, which seemed to be her thing.

He stood and wiped his hand on his shorts. "Just checking. I'm a safety guy."

She looked at his chest as if she might find a badge. "Be safe, then." She disappeared back inside.

Brody stared at the drain again. The suction was barely there, a slow draw. It wasn't dangerous. He had once gotten his swim cap stuck on a drain during practice; he had yanked it off without thought. He had heard the stories about hair and skin and water that wouldn't let go. Those were for kids. Those were for people who panicked. He didn't panic.

He returned to his lounge chair and scrolled through his feed. The poll was already in his favor. He smiled. Even strangers knew he was right.

---

By late afternoon the courtyard filled like a pool of its own. Guests drifted in with towels around their waists and plastic cups sweating in their hands. The bar finally opened. A portable speaker coughed out music that sounded like someone had chopped a song into pieces and glued it back together wrong.

Brody lay on his stomach and watched people from under his sunglasses. He liked to observe before he jumped in. The girl with the matching hat had traded it for a bikini and a sunburn. The couple from the couch argued in whispers about money and the map. The guy with the compass tattoo was awake now, chatting with a woman whose laugh rang out in sharp bursts like breaking ice.

A boy with bleached hair and a neon wristband jumped in the pool, did a cannonball, and sent a wave over the edge. The staff guy with the rope neck came out and told him to chill. The boy rolled his eyes, climbed onto the pool edge, and ran his hand through his hair like a shampoo commercial.

Brody decided he did not like him.

He slid into the water at the deep end, kept his movements easy. A few heads turned. He felt the familiar heat of attention. It settled on his skin like sunlight. He made a slow lap, then a faster one, then flipped at the wall just to show he could. The pool was too shallow to do a proper turn, so he improvised, his heels scraping the tile. The roughness caught his skin, but he kept going, turning the scrape into a joke with himself. He was used to worse. He had been in worse. He was the kind of person who collected "worse" as if it were a resume line.

He surfaced at the ladder and found the neon-wristband boy beside him, panting.

"You swim on a team?" the boy asked.

"Used to," Brody said.

"I can tell." The boy said it like a compliment and like a dare.

Brody smiled with only half his mouth. "People can tell."

A woman near the edge lifted her drink. "Show us something," she said.

He could have shrugged, could have said he wasn't here to perform. But the moment had the shape of something else. He looked at the ladder. He looked at the deep end. He felt the subtle tug of the pump, like a finger on his heel. The water had a current; it pulled toward the drain. He could use it.

He dove.

It wasn't a true dive, not enough depth for that, but he angled down and cut through the water with his arms, letting the current take him. He rolled under and pushed off the bottom, the suction sliding past his shoulder. He surfaced, went under again, did a small spin. He could hear people laughing, clapping. The sound was muffled through the water, warm and far away. He felt the way he always felt in water: invincible in the only element that ever let him be quiet.

When he climbed out, the boy with the wristband slapped his shoulder. "Dude, teach me that." He stumbled a little from the wet tile, caught his balance.

"Sure," Brody said, and meant no part of it.

He went to his towel, checked his phone. The story had blown up, as small things did when you were just famous enough. He replied to a few comments with flame emojis. Someone had asked if the pool was safe. He typed, "Safe if you know what you're doing," and hit send.

He didn't see the woman with the drink look at the drain. He didn't see the staff guy watching him from the bar. He didn't see the hairline crack along the grout by the deep end, the way the tile seemed to bulge, as if it had been lifted from below.

The sun dropped behind the building. The courtyard fell into a syrupy golden light. The pool went from turquoise to dark blue. The pump hummed, and beneath it there was another sound, a low throaty gurgle, like a stomach deciding if it wanted to keep what it had.

Brody stayed in the water until the light was gone.

---

That night, the hostel took on its other face. The bar filled, the music shifted to something faster, the air turned sweaty and sweet. The pool looked black from the corner of his eye, a glossy slab of night with the moon trying to find itself in it.

He sat on a plastic chair with a rum and some kind of citrus, listening to the neon-wristband boy tell a story about a ferry and a goat. The boy's name was Theo. He was twenty-two and had a jawline that probably had its own Instagram. Brody liked him despite himself.

"So you were a lifeguard?" Theo said, leaning in. His eyes were too clear, his smile too sure.

"For a summer," Brody said. It had been three summers, but admitting that would make him sound less like someone who had left because he wanted to, not because he had been told the pool didn't have money for him anymore.

"Must be boring," Theo said.

"Not if you like people watching," Brody said. He took a sip. The drink tasted like a cough drop that had been left on a radiator.

Across the pool, the receptionist sat on a low wall, scrolling her phone, the screen lighting her face from below like a ghost story. The staff guy was mixing drinks with quick movements, his fingers steady. A girl with damp hair was telling everyone about a temple she'd visited, her hands drawing shapes in the air. A dog barked from the street.

Brody glanced at the pool. A group of guests were sitting with their feet in it, shoes off, toes wrinkled. The pump kept its steady hum. The water moved in slow circles. The drain's shadow was deeper now, a bruise at the bottom.

He felt a tug in his chest, that old urge to go under when it was dark, when it was just you and the water and the world could not find you. He told himself he was done swimming for the day. He told himself he had a hangover to avoid and a bed to enjoy. He told himself all the reasonable things he had always said before he did whatever he wanted anyway.

Theo stood and stretched. "I'm going for a dip," he said.

"At night?" Brody said.

"Water doesn't sleep." Theo grinned. He pulled his shirt over his head and stepped onto the tile, skin already gleaming.

"The rules say no swimming after ten," the receptionist said without looking up.

Theo checked his wrist. "It's nine fifty-eight," he said, and jumped.

The water swallowed him. It was clean, fast, forgiving. He surfaced with a laugh and flicked water at the people on the edge. Someone squealed. The staff guy didn't move.

Brody watched Theo glide across the pool, his strokes confident but not sharp. The water made soft slaps against the tile. The pump hummed. The sound underneath it, that low gurgle, pulsed once like a heartbeat.

"Come on," Theo said, treading water. "Show me the flip."

Brody hesitated. His drink sweated in his hand, the rim slick. He set it down and stood. The tile was cool against his soles now, the heat drained away. He stepped to the edge.

"Just one," he said, mostly to himself.

He slid in, the cold hitting him like a slap. He dove under and felt the world go quiet. It was the best kind of quiet, the kind that turned all thoughts into bubbles. He swam toward the deep end, where the water was darker, where the light from the bar didn't reach.

His hand brushed the bottom. It was colder here, like the pool was deeper than it was. He turned on his back, looked up. The moon was a coin. It was a penny. It was the smell of the water.

When he kicked, he felt the pull of the drain more clearly. It tugged at his shin, at his ankle, a slow deliberate draw. It wasn't strong enough to scare him. It was strong enough to be interesting.

He surfaced and grabbed the edge, then pushed off. He was about to show Theo the flip when a sound from the pump changed, the steady hum dropping into a sluggish throb. The water shifted under him, the current reversing for a beat. The lights over the bar flickered.

Theo stopped in the middle of the pool. "Did you see that?" he said.

"Probably the generator," Brody said. The hostel looked like it ran on excuses and extension cords. He swam to the deep end and tried the flip. His heels scraped the tile again. He surfaced, spit water, and saw the staff guy staring at the pump housing as if it had spoken to him.

"Hey," Brody called. "You good?"

The staff guy didn't answer. He squatted, pressed his hand to the pump case. A faint shudder ran through the water. The gurgle, low and wet, rolled into a steady suck.

Brody felt it against his calf. He kicked away, laughing, because it was funny, because it was nothing, because it was the pool doing what pools did.

"Last lap," he said to Theo. "Then bed."

Theo nodded. He was already moving to the shallow end, and Brody was already moving toward the dark center.

He dove.

Underwater, the world was a bluish smear. The drain was a black eye. As he passed over it, the suction licked at his thighs. It was stronger than before, a firm grip of water. He liked it. It was a handshake. A dare. He rolled under, pushed off the bottom, and kicked up.

Something brushed his ankle.

He whipped around, expecting Theo, expecting a foot. There was nothing. Only the pull, a slow steady insistence. He surfaced and laughed, but it was thin.

"Seriously," he called to Theo. "This pump is on steroids."

Theo didn't answer. Theo was already out, hair plastered to his forehead, towel around his shoulders.

Brody was alone in the water.

He floated on his back, letting the pull work at him. His heartbeat slowed. The sky above was soft and cloudless. The hostel's laughter faded as people drifted inside. The bar music shifted to something slower. The pump hummed with a deepening note.

He closed his eyes.

A hand touched his foot.

He jerked, eyes open. Nothing. The edge of the pool, the tiles, the dark water. He swallowed water and coughed. He told himself it was his own foot, a cramp, a stray ripple. He told himself the pool was just a pool.

"All good?" the receptionist called from the doorway.

"All good," he said.

He swam to the ladder and climbed out, water streaming from him. He stood dripping on the tile, the night air raising goosebumps. He looked at the drain. In the dark, it was only a circle of black, a pupil. He thought of an eye again, watching from below.

He stepped back, grabbed his towel.

As he walked toward the door, the pump made a sound like a breath being taken and held.

He didn't turn around.

The pool did not look like a mouth anymore. It looked like a closed throat.

---

He lay in his bunk and watched the ceiling fan turn. The room smelled of mosquito repellent and feet. Someone's phone buzzed with a call they didn't answer. A few beds down, a girl murmured in her sleep, the language soft and unfamiliar. The city outside hummed with scooters and distant music.

Brody put his phone on his chest and scrolled through his story replies. People wanted the pool. People wanted him in the pool. People wanted him everywhere. He felt the old hunger, the one that told him to give them what they wanted before they stopped wanting.

A single notification sat at the top of his feed, a DM from a user he didn't recognize. The handle was @hostelreaper, the icon a black-and-white photo of a lifebuoy.

He clicked it.

"Blue is hungry," it said.

He snorted, half amused, half annoyed. He typed, "So am I." He added a shrug emoji and hit send. The reply bubble blinked three dots, then vanished.

He tossed the phone onto his pillow and closed his eyes. The fan chopped the air into a rhythm. Somewhere beneath the building, the pool pump kept its own beat, steady and patient.

He dreamed of water that would not let go.
